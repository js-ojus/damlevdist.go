NAME
    similarity - find and print text similarity between sets of strings

SYNOPSIS
    similarity combfile

    similarity reffile testfile

DESCRIPTION
    similarity is a program that finds the Damerau-Levenshtein distance
    between strings.

    The first form of invocation treats the contents of the file
    'combfile' to be strings that each needs to be compared with all the
    others in the file.

    The second form treats those from the file 'reffile' to be correct
    reference strings, against which those in the file 'testfile' should
    be compared.

    In all cases, the input files should have one string per line.
    Blank lines are ignored.  The program does trim the strings, but
    users should take care of non-printable characters themselves.

    The output will be one line printed for each combination of strings,
    and has the following format:

        pd d tl rl tstr rstr

    where, 'd' is the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between strings 'tstr'
    'rstr'; 'tl' and 'rl' are the line numbers of test string 'tstr' and
    reference string 'rstr', respectively; and 'pd' is calculated as:

        d / (len(tstr) + len(rstr)).
